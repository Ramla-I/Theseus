# Verification in Theseus
We verify every crate that contains prusti specification separately. This is so we can ignore all the dependencies of a crates using the `no_verify_deps flag`, as many of the dependencies are not used for verification. Using this flag, specs are exported but not verified. Within the crate itself, we mark the functions that actually need to be verified with `#[verified]` which works with the `opt_in_verification` flag. We also use the `skip_unsupported_features` flag so Prusti will only give warnings rather than an error when compiling code with unsupported features. This is ok because we don't need to verify any function with unsupported features. BUT, you have to be careful. If you place `#[verified]` on a function with an unsupported feature like an iterator, Prusti will not verify it but you will think it has since it doesn't give an error.

In the `verify.sh` file, we list all the application and kernel crates with Prusti specification and then verify them one by one. An easy way to check we have the complete list is to search for all crates with prusti_contracts in their dependency lists.
